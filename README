This directory contains everything you need to use sslog, a super
simple log file format for performance visualization using jumpshot-4.
A converter from the super simple log to slog2 (the native format
understood by jumpshot-4).  It also contains the original, intact
tarball of slog2 SDK.  

You can either point to existing slog2 (jumpshot) installation in
which case you do not need to compile the jumpshot, or can let it
automatically install slog2 from the bundled tarball.  Either way, it
still needs a part of its source file for compling sslog, so the
tarball is always unpacked.

== INSTALL ==

The standard procedure will compile sslog and slog2sdk automatically.

  cd src;
  ./configure --with-java=... [ --prefix=... ]
  make
  make install

If you already have a slog2 (jumpshot-4) installation, you may instead do:

  cd src;
  ./configure --with-jumpshot=... --with-java=... [ --prefix=... ]
  make
  make install

== FILES ==

Enjoy!
