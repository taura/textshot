This directory contains everything you need to use textshot event log.
A converter from the textshot log to slog2 (the native format
understood by jumpshot).  It also contains the original, intact
tarball of slog2 SDK for your convenience.

== FILES ==
src/  sources (modified trace_impl.c and sslog.in)
ex/   some examples
doc/  some documents
done/ an empty directory to which Makefile records what has been done
slog2sdk.tar.gz : unmodified slog2 + jumpshot toolkit

Enjoy!
